# **Comparative analysis of the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of Capomulin.** 
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

 This analysis is broken down into the following tasks:

* Clean up and preparation the data.

* Summary statistics.

* Data visualization using bar charts and pie charts.

* Descriptive statistical analysis using quartiles and box plots

* Calculate correlation and regression.

* Final analysis.
